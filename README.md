This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby:  modifying a read-only attribute.  The `bug.rb` file shows the erroneous code that attempts to assign a new value to an implicitly read-only attribute. The solution, in `bugSolution.rb`, provides a corrected version where the attribute can be updated properly.
